                <p>Alittle about me is that I really enjoy traveling, Writing mustic (usually in the post hardcore genre), I'm a big foodie and is one of the big reasons I love traveling, I currently live in SWFL but am avaidly looking to move to either 
                 seattle or columbus after this last hurricane, I am a big gamer but usually just sticking to a few games either cards like MTG or shooters such as APEX. I initially thought I wanted to go into  finicial analytics but after alot of research and starting my college journey I ended up taking a intro to programming class.
                This class ended up showing me that I got this like rush of dopamine when I would figure out what was wrong in my code and after that I was hooked. I decided i'll put college on hold and do a bootcamp so I can get in the industry and then put both the knowledge from the bootcamp and college into practice. 
                I'm excited for what 2023 holds!! </p>
